# App Shell Status

## Scope

Bubble Tea root model, navigation, shared screen state, refresh rules, global key routing.

## Current status

In progress. Root Bubble Tea shell is in place and the main screens are wired.

## Completed work

- Defined root-model responsibilities and boundaries.
- Mapped startup behavior to existing TUI behavior.
- Mapped shared keybindings and screen transitions.
- Implemented the Go root model, startup binary resolution, shell routing, and workspace/request/auth/secret/send screen switching.
- Added the session/state primitives, key translation helpers, and overlay hooks that the feature views consume.

## Work in progress

- Connecting mutation submission and overlay results back into the shell.

## Blockers

- Large-body request editing remains an open future concern.

## Files touched

## Important decisions

- Single root Bubble Tea model with child screens and modal overlays.
- Navigation owns context only; entity modules own their own data flows.

## Next steps

- Wire the structured draft/result APIs from the view packages into the shell mutation handlers.

## Resume notes

- The root shell already renders all major screens; the next work is mutation and overlay completion.
